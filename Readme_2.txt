Text Generation with a Pre-trained Model
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to perform text generation using a pre-trained transformer model (DistilGPT2) from the Hugging Face transformers library. It showcases various parameters to control the output of the generation process.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a simple yet comprehensive example of using a pre-trained language model to generate new text based on a given prompt. It highlights how different sampling strategies and parameters can influence the creativity, coherence, and diversity of the generated output.

Features
Environment Setup: Installs necessary libraries (transformers, torch).

Pipeline API: Utilizes the Hugging Face pipeline API for easy text generation setup.

Pre-trained Model: Loads distilgpt2, a smaller and faster version of GPT-2.

Diverse Generation Options: Demonstrates:

Basic generation with max_length.

Generating multiple sequences (num_return_sequences).

Controlling randomness with do_sample and temperature.

Applying top_k and top_p (nucleus sampling) for focused yet diverse generation.

Setup and Running in Google Colab
The most straightforward way to execute this project is directly within Google Colab:

Open the Notebook: Click on the Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1khb2JHJQ1fDxsZczsjPxCmqcI00rZHFK?usp=sharing

Run All Cells: Navigate to Runtime -> Run all in the Colab menu.

GPU Acceleration (Optional but Recommended): Although distilgpt2 is small, using a GPU can speed up generation. Ensure you have a GPU runtime enabled: Runtime -> Change runtime type and select GPU as the hardware accelerator.

Model
Name: distilgpt2

Description: A distilled version of the GPT-2 model, offering similar performance to the original but with fewer parameters and faster inference. It's suitable for quick experimentation with text generation.

Text Generation Parameters
The notebook explores several key parameters that control the text generation process:

max_length: The maximum number of tokens to generate, including the prompt.

num_return_sequences: The number of independent text sequences to generate.

do_sample: If True, uses sampling (non-deterministic) for generation; if False (default), uses greedy decoding or beam search (deterministic).

temperature: (Requires do_sample=True) Controls the randomness of predictions. Higher values (e.g., 1.0 or more) make the output more random; lower values (e.g., 0.7) make it more deterministic.

top_k: (Requires do_sample=True) Considers only the k most likely next tokens at each step, reducing the vocabulary size for sampling.

top_p (Nucleus Sampling): (Requires do_sample=True) Considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p. This provides a dynamic vocabulary size, often leading to more fluid and diverse text than top_k alone.

Dependencies
The notebook automatically installs the required libraries:

transformers

torch

Combined Code
For convenience, all the code from the Google Colab notebook has been combined into a single Python script. This script can be run in any Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
